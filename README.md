# The-Memory-Game
A game that tests the user's memory by giving them a set amount of cards with matching pairs.
The cards will be shown in entirety to the user and then turn so that none are visible. The user
will then have to remember where each of them are and click on the squares where there are matching pairs.
The more pairs the user can find, the higher the score.

This is my first project ever as a developer, so I'll be sharing with you my goals
whilst putting the whole thing together. 


MVP Goals (Minimum Viable Product)
Give the user a greeting and instructions before the game actually begins.
Have a scoreboard that updates itself, or at the least lets the user know what the current score is after every move
A visible count that shows the user how many pairs they found
Have a certain amount of wrong pair chances until the game is lost
A visible count that shows the user how many moves they've made

Stretch Goals (If I have enough time, what I hope to achieve)
I want different animations to play when the game ends for both the loss and win announcer
I want to do small animations for the user selection of the cards
I want to add noises for card selection and end game announcer
